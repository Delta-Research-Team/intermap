# InterMap

> Accelerated Detection of Interaction Fingerprints on Large-Scale Molecular Ensembles


Hey there! You landed on the official repository for the InterMap project, which aims to provide an efficient and
scalable
framework for detecting interaction fingerprints in large-scale molecular ensembles (e.g., Molecular Dynamics).

An interaction fingerprint (IFP) is essentially a binary string where each bit represents a specific type of
interaction (such as hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic contacts, ionic interactions, π-π stacking, etc.) between particular
atoms or residues in the protein and the ligand. A bit is set to 1 if the interaction is present and 0 if it is absent,
based on predefined geometric and chemical criteria.

## Documentation

All documentation, including installation instructions, usage guides, and visualization options for the results, can be
found at the online [InterMap Documentation](https://Delta-Research-Team.github.io/intermap/).
